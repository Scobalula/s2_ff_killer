# s2_ff_killer

A tool to decrypt Call of Duty: World War II's Fast File. This tool was made to allow people making HUDs in Call of Duty: Black Ops III's mod tools to aquire the assets needed to port HUDs from Call of Duty: World War II.

# Usage

s2_ff_killer itself doesn't rip or decompress fast files and instead simply decrypts them. This allows it to be used by other tools simply by calling it to handle the decryption.

To decrypt fast files simply pass them into the command line or drag and drop them onto the exe. A file with `decrypted.ff` at the end will be produced.

# Reporting Issues

If you find an issue with the tool please don't hesititate to file an issue and I'll try and fix it. The tool hasn't seen widespread use but some visual observations indicated it seems to be decrpyting the data correctly.
 
# Disclaimer

As mentioned the intent of the tool is to simply port images not accessible in-game. It is not made to try and enable cheating or any other malicious activities, the game itself already does further anti-tamper checks.

I am putting this out there as unlicensed software essentially in the public domain to do what you want. I made it since several people have asked about WW2 UI Images in the modding community and I wanted a challenge. I hope the code is useful to you.
